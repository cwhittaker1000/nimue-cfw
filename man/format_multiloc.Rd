\title{Format multi-location vaccine model output}
\usage{
format_multiloc(
  x,
  compartments = c("S", "E", "IMild", "ICase", "IHosp", "R", "D"),
  reduce_age = TRUE,
  date_0 = NULL,
  replicate = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{nimue_simulation object returned by \code{run()}.}

\item{compartments}{Vector of compartment names present in the model output,
  e.g. \code{c("S", "R")}, or sub-compartment names (e.g.
  \code{c("S", "E1", "E2")}).}

\item{reduce_age}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default) collapse the age
  dimension while retaining location indices, otherwise keep age-specific
  counts.}

\item{date_0}{Optional Date for time 0 (e.g. "2020-03-01"); if provided a
  \code{date} column is added.}

\item{replicate}{Replicate to format. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A data.frame in long format containing the selected compartments,
  time, replicate, and location (and optionally age group) labels.
}
\description{
Takes raw odin vaccine model output from \code{run()} (with multiple
locations) and returns a long data frame. Selected compartments are extracted
(with cumulative outputs converted to daily increments) while optionally
collapsing the age dimension. Location indices are preserved in the output.
