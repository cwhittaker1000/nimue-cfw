\arguments{
\item{countries}{Character vector of locations to include in the simulation. Populations and baseline contact matrices are sourced for each country.}

\item{age_breaks}{Numeric vector specifying the upper bound of each age group. If \code{NULL}, the default 17-group structure is used.}

\item{R0}{Basic reproduction number for each time period specified in \code{tt_R0}. Default is 3.}

\item{tt_R0}{Time points (in days) at which \code{R0} changes. Defaults to 0 (no change).}

\item{beta_set}{Optional alternative parameterisation via beta rather than \code{R0}. If \code{NULL}, beta is derived from \code{R0}.}

\item{q_flight}{Daily probability of travelling by flight for each country.}

\item{pi_travel_flight}{Matrix of destination probabilities for flight travel (home country in rows, destination in columns).}

\item{q_non_flight}{Daily probability of travelling by non-flight transport for each country.}

\item{pi_travel_non_flight}{Matrix of destination probabilities for non-flight travel (home country in rows, destination in columns).}

\item{time_period}{Length of the simulation in days. Default is 365.}

\item{replicates}{Number of stochastic replicates. Currently fixed to 1 in the underlying model.}

\item{seed}{Random seed used for simulations. Default draws from \code{runif(1, 0, 1e+08)}.}

\item{prob_hosp}{Probability of hospitalisation by age group.}

\item{prob_death_hosp}{Probability of death among hospitalised cases by age group.}

\item{rel_infectiousness}{Relative infectiousness per age category.}

\item{rel_infectiousness_vaccinated}{Relative infectiousness for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals by age group.}

\item{dur_E}{Mean duration of incubation period (days).}

\item{dur_IMild}{Mean duration of mild infection (days).}

\item{dur_ICase}{Mean duration from symptom onset to hospital admission (days).}

\item{dur_IHosp}{Mean duration of hospitalisation (days).}

\item{dur_V}{Mean duration of vaccine-derived immunity (days).}

\item{vaccine_efficacy_infection}{Vaccine efficacy against infection, either a single value or a vector by age group.}

\item{vaccine_efficacy_disease}{Vaccine efficacy against severe disease, either a single value or a vector by age group.}

\item{max_vaccine}{Maximum number of vaccine doses available per day.}

\item{max_vaccine_set}{Optional matrix specifying vaccine capacity over time and by location (rows are time, columns are countries).}

\item{tt_vaccine}{Time points (in days) when vaccine capacity changes.}

\item{dur_vaccine_delay}{Delay (in days) before vaccine-derived immunity becomes effective.}

\item{vaccine_coverage_mat}{Matrix of target vaccine coverage by time (rows) and age group (columns).}

\item{seeding_cases}{Initial number of cases used to seed the epidemic.}

\item{seeding_age_order}{Optional integer vector controlling the order in which seeds are allocated to age groups. If \code{NULL}, seeds are distributed randomly within working ages.}

\item{init}{Optional list of initial conditions for the simulation.}

\item{use_dde}{Logical indicating whether to use the \code{dde} implementation (default) or \code{deSolve}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying odin model \code{run} method.}
